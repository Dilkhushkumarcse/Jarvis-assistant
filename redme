Great question 👍 Let me walk you step by step on how to **push your code to GitHub using Git**.

---

## ✅ Steps to Push Code to GitHub

### 1. **Install Git (if not installed)**

Check if Git is installed:

```bash
git --version
```

If not installed, download from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

---

### 2. **Initialize Git in your project**

Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd "d:\Project Drive\Jarvis"
```

Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

---

### 3. **Connect GitHub repository**

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* Create a new repository (e.g., `Jarvis`).
* Copy the repository URL (HTTPS is easiest).

Example:

```
https://github.com/your-username/Jarvis.git
```

Now connect your local folder to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/Jarvis.git
```

---

### 4. **Add files and commit**

Stage all files:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Jarvis project"
```

---

### 5. **Push to GitHub**

Push your code:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 6. **Check on GitHub**

Refresh your GitHub repo page — you should see your code uploaded 🎉

---

## 🔁 After first time

When you make changes later:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated Jarvis with Google Cloud Speech"
git push
```

---

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to **connect VS Code directly to GitHub** (so you can push/pull with just clicks instead of commands)?
